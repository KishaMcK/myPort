                        “At cocktail parties, I played the part of a successful businessman's wife to perfection. I
                        smiled, I made polite chit-chat, and I dressed the part. Denial and rationalization were two of
                        my most effective tools in working my way through our social obligations. I believed that
                        playing the roles of wife and mother were the least I could do to help support Tom's career.
                        During the day, I was a puzzle with innumerable pieces. One piece made my family a nourishing
                        breakfast. Another piece ferried the kids to school and to soccer practice. A third piece
                        managed to trip to the grocery store. There was also a piece that wanted to sleep for eighteen
                        hours a day and the piece that woke up shaking from yet another nightmare. And there was the
                        piece that attended business functions and actually fooled people into thinking I might have
                        something constructive to offer.
                        I was a circus performer traversing the tightwire, and I could fall off into a vortex devoid of
                        reality at any moment. There was, and had been for a very long time, an intense sense of
                        despair. A self-deprecating voice inside told me I had no chance of getting better. I lived in
                        an emotional black hole.
                        p20-21, talking about dissociative identity disorder (formerly multiple personality disorder).”
